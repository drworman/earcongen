"""Making standard output usable on Windows GUI builds.

The EarconGen binary is built with ``console=False`` so that launching
them does not flash up a console window. On Windows that puts the
executable in the GUI subsystem, where it starts with no console
attached and PyInstaller leaves ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr``
unusable. Anything printed then vanishes, and flushing at exit raises
``OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument``.

That is fine for the graphical interface, which prints nothing, but it
breaks the ``--cli`` interface completely: output disappears whether the
user is reading it in a terminal or a script is capturing it. The release
workflow's smoke test depends on it, so a regression here fails a build
rather than shipping quietly.

This module reconnects the streams. It handles both cases:

*Redirected* — ``edsg.exe --cli version > out.txt``, or a shell
capturing the output. The shell has already given the process valid
standard handles, inherited at creation. They just need wrapping back
into Python file objects.

*Interactive* — the user runs the command in an existing console.
There are no inherited handles, so the process attaches to the console
of whichever process launched it and picks up the handles that creates.

Everything here is a no-op off Windows.
